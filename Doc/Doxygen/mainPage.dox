\mainpage OpenGL Image Processing Library (GLIP-Lib)

\section sec_intro Introduction
	GLIP-LIB : The OpenGL Image Processing LIBrary is a C++ library which provides some tools to design image processing pipelines based on hardware accelerated computing (GPGPU) via OpenGL and GLSL. It uses a graph oriented approach to the description of processing tasks : you describe, in the initialization of the program, your processing pipeline as a series of filters (each can have multiple inputs and outputs). Then, you apply inputs as different image on the port(s) of the pipeline(s) and obtain the results at the output port(s).

	This library also ensures that the processing of images is not only made as a general purpose computation task on the GPU, but effectively use hardware enabled advantages of such architecture such as textured memory for fast global memory access, fast linear algebra in 2,3 and 4 dimensions and fast floating point functions. Moreover, this library can be interface either with CUDA or OpenCL APIs. Another advantage is the Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation of the shaders on the targeted plateform by the display driver. This guarantees at the same time the highest performances on the hardware and the flexibility in algorithm development.

	The library, in itself, DOES NOT provide any function for context handling (except for GLEW) nor image acquisition from files, videos or cameras, nor display tools. However, we provide examples and easily reusable code for interfacing the library with Qt, GLFW and FFMPEG.

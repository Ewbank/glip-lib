\mainpage OpenGL Image Processing Library (GLIP-Lib)

\section section_introduction Introduction
	GLIP-Lib is an OpenGL image processing library written in C++. It features all the necessary tools to quickly build texture filters and pipelines and operate them on the GPU.
	- Process large images at video frame-rate.
	- Container language for OpenGL and GLSL : develop and test complex pipelines without recompiling the application.
	- Interact with filters and modify their parameters while they are running.
	- Multiple-Platform : built and tested on Windows and Linux.
	- Only depends on OpenGL API and C++ STL.
	- Interoperable with Cuda and OpenCL. Can be used as a live programmable data visualizer.

	The GLIP-Lib project also provides two tools to develop, test and use pipelines :
	- GlipStudio : a graphical development environment for Windows and Linux (\ref page13_ToolGlipStudio).
	- GlipCompute : a command-line utility for Linux (\ref page12_ToolGlipCompute).
